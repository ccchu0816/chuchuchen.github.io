                  <h2>Visual-Inertial-Aided Online MAV System Identification</h2>
                  <p>
                     System modeling and parameter identification of micro aerial vehicles (MAV) are crucial for robust autonomy, especially under highly dynamic motions. Visual-inertial-aided online parameter identification has recently seen research attention due to the demanding of adaptation to platform configuration changes with minimal onboard sensor requirements.
                     To this end, we design an online MAV system identification algorithm to tightly fuse visual, inertial and MAV aerodynamic information within a lightweight multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF) framework.
                     In particular, while one could blindly fuse the MAV dynamic-induced relative motion constraints in EKF, we numerically show that due to the (quadrotor) MAV system modeling inaccuracy, they often become overconfident and negatively impact the state estimates. As such, we leverage the Schmidt-Kalman filter (SKF) for MAV system parameter identification to prevent corruption of state estimates.
                     Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we validate the proposed SKF-based scheme and demonstrate its ability to perform robust system identification even in the presence of an inconsistent MAV dynamic model under different motions.

                  <h2>FEJ2: A Consistent Visual-Inertial State Estimator Design</h2>
                  <p>
                     In this paper, we propose a novel consistent state  estimator design for visual-inertial systems.
                     Motivated by first estimates Jacobian (FEJ) based estimators – which uses the first-ever estimates as linearization points to preserve proper observability properties of the linearized estimator thereby improving the consistency – we carefully model measurement linearization errors due to its Jacobian evaluation and propose a methodology which still leverages FEJ to ensure the estimator’s observability properties, but additionally explicitly compensate for linearization errors caused by poor first estimates.
                     We term this estimator FEJ2, which directly addresses the discrepancy between the best Jacobian evaluated at the latest state estimate and the first-estimates Jacobian evaluated at the first-time-ever state estimate. We show that this process explicitly models that the FEJ used is imperfect and thus contributes additional error which, as in FEJ2, should be modeled and consistently increase the state covariance during update.
                     The proposed FEJ2 is evaluated against state-of-the-art visual-inertial estimators in both Monte-Carlo simulations and real-world experiments, which has been shown to outperform existing methods and to robustly handle poor first estimates and high measurement noises.

                  <h2>Decoupled Right Invariant Error States for Consistent Visual-Inertial Navigation</h2>
                  <p>
                     The invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) is
                     proven to preserve the observability property of visual-inertial
                     navigation systems (VINS) and suitable for consistent estimator
                     design. However, if features are maintained in the state vector, the
                     propagation of IEKF will become more computationally expensive
                     because these features are involved in the covariance propagation.
                     To address this issue, we propose two novel algorithms which
                     preserve the system consistency by leveraging the invariant state
                     representation and ensure efficiency by decoupling features from
                     covariance propagation. The first algorithm combines right invariant error states with first-estimates Jacobian (FEJ) technique, by
                     decoupling the features from the Lie group representation and
                     utilizing FEJ for consistent estimation. The second algorithm is
                     designed specifically for sliding-window filter-based VINS as it associates the features to an active cloned pose, instead of the current
                     IMU state, for Lie group representation. A new pseudo-anchor
                     change algorithm is also proposed to maintain the features in the
                     state vector longer than the window span. Both decoupled rightand left-invariant error based VINS methods are implemented for a
                     complete comparison. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on three
                     simulated trajectories and real world evaluations on the TUM-VI
                     datasets are provided to verify our analysis and demonstrate that
                     the proposed algorithms can achieve improved accuracy than a
                     state-of-art filter-based VINS algorithm using FEJ.

                  <h2>Analytic Combined IMU Integration (ACI^2) For Visual Inertial Navigation</h2>
                  <p>
                     Batch optimization based inertial measurement
                     unit (IMU) and visual sensor fusion enables high rate localization for many robotic tasks. However, it remains a challenge to
                     ensure that the batch optimization is computationally efficient
                     while being consistent for high rate IMU measurements without
                     marginalization. In this paper, we derive inspiration from
                     maximum likelihood estimation with partial-fixed estimates
                     to provide a unified approach for handing both IMU preintegration and time-offset calibration. We present a modularized analytic combined IMU integrator (ACI2
                     ) with elegant
                     derivations for IMU integrations, bias Jabcobians and related
                     covariances. To simplify our derivation, we also prove that
                     the right Jacobians for Hamilton quaterions and SO(3) are
                     equivalent. Finally, we present a time offset calibrator that
                     operates by fixing the linearization point for a given time
                     offset. This reduces re-integration of the IMU measurements
                     and thus improve efficiency. The proposed ACI2
                     and time-offset
                     calibration is verified by intensive Monte-Carlo simulations
                     generated from real world datasets. A proof-of-concept real
                     world experiment is also conducted to verify the proposed ACI2
                     estimator.
